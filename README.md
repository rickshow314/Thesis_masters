# Master's Thesis Project Introduction - Integration of Genetic Mutation Data

## Project Description

This repository is part of a master's thesis project focused on addressing the complexity and diversity of databases related to genetic mutations. The existence of multiple databases, each with their own formats and types of information, creates a significant challenge for integrated data querying and analysis. This project aims to develop an RDF (Resource Description Framework) based model to semantically represent information about genetic mutations from different sources in a standardized and interoperable way.

## Objectives

- **Data Integration**: Merge information from various genetic databases, overcoming intra and inter-domain challenges.
- **RDF Modeling**: Create an RDF model that allows a unified and accessible representation of genetic mutations.
- **Data Reuse**: Leverage existing resources in the network, avoiding redundancy and promoting efficiency.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitate complex queries and integrated analyses using semantic web technologies.

## Methodology

1. **Database Familiarization**: Study and understand the structures and information provided by the selected databases.
2. **Conceptual Model Development**: Create a conceptual diagram with key entities and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize data from databases to a format compatible with the RDF model.
4. **RDF File Generation**: Serialize data into RDF files using tools like rdflib.
5. **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Load RDF files into a knowledge graph, using platforms like Virtuoso.
6. **Use Cases and SPARQL Queries**: Demonstrate the graph's potential through complex queries and its interoperability.
7. **Documentation**: Detailed recording of the project's processes, decisions, and outcomes.

## Tools and Technologies

- RDF and SPARQL for data modeling and querying.
- Semantic web tools for standardized information representation.
- Platforms like Virtuoso for knowledge graph management.
- rdflib and similar tools for RDF file generation.

## Contribution and Collaboration

This project is open to contributions from students, researchers, and anyone interested in genetic data integration. Contributions can include improvements to the code, suggestions in data modeling, or innovative use cases.
