# Scripts Folder

## Overview

This folder contains various scripts and Jupyter Notebooks that are essential for processing and analyzing data. Each script and notebook is designed to perform specific tasks that contribute to the larger project workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts or notebooks in this folder, you must ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that you have the following libraries installed:

- `gzip`: For reading and writing gzip-compressed files.
- `pandas`: Provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools.
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.

You can install these libraries using `pip` if they are not already installed:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

If you are using Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files), make sure you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it via pip:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
