In this folder we find three examples of different diagrams:


- Complete Concept Diagram: A complete diagram that encompasses all the properties and entities that we might initially want our RDF to contain.
- Diagram with real ClinVar example: A diagram with a real example of variant present in the database of ClinVar.
- Diagram with real example dbVar: A diagram with a real example of variant present in the database of dbVar.
