## Folder Structure and Configuration

### Overview
In this folder, the mappings are organized by database due to their distinct structures. Each database requires its specific configuration, including the necessary YARRRML mapping files and the configuration for `morph-kgc` to generate RDF triples effectively.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the `morph-kgc` tool. If you do not have `morph-kgc` installed, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install morph-kgc
```
##### Generating RDF Triples
Use this command:
```bash
Python morph-kgc.py
```
